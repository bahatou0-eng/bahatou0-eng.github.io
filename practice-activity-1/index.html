<h2> Why I am selling my prized collection </h2>
<p><b>I'm selling my vintage jewelry collection to help cover my tuition.</b> Most of these pieces I found at different <em>pawn shops</em> over the years, picking what caught my eye because of the style and character. It is not easy to let them go but <b>school has to come first.</b>
    </p> 
    <p> A lot of the <b> jewelry </b> is one of a kind, and that makes the collection even more valuable. It includes rings, necklaces, and unique statement pieces that you will not find everywhere. <b> Each piece feels like it carries its own story </b>, and I have enjoyed collecting them throughout the years. I would love for someone else to enjoy them the way I did and give them a new home. Owning vintage jewelry is <em>special</em> because it connects you to both style and history. </p>
    <p>Buying from me is not just about getting jewelry, it is about supporting my education. When you purchase from this collection, you are directly helping me stay in school and work toward my degree. At the same time, you are gaining timeless vintage pieces that can last for years to come. It is a way for both of us to benefit, which makes this sale meaningful. With your help, I can pay off my tuition while you walk away with jewelry that will always stand out.</p>
