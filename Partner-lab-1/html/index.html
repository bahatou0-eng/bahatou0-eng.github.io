<h2> Welcome to ARCHV </h2>

<div class="myDiv">
<p><b>Welcome to ARCHV, a curated archive of fashion pieces that tell stories across decades.</b> We believe style is timeless and each piece deserves a second life. Our goal is to share clothing that combines <em>heritage</em>, craftsmanship, and individuality, offering alternatives to disposable fast fashion.
</p> 

<p class="mission-statement"> Our mission is to provide access to unique garments while promoting <b>sustainable consumption</b>. Each piece in the archive is handpicked for its story, construction, and cultural relevance. <b>Instead of fast fashion,</b> we showcase wardrobes that rotate but never expire in value. Shopping here is not just about owning clothes; it's about connecting with style history. </p>

<p class="mission-statement"> Buying from ARCHV is about more than getting clothes. It is about <em>supporting sustainability</em>, celebrating timeless design, and carrying forward fashion with meaning. With every piece, you are joining a community that values the past, embraces the present, and invests in a more conscious future. </p>
